A compiler is a software program that translates the entire source code of an application into machine code before the application is executed. This means that the compiled code can be executed directly by a computer without the need for any additional translation. On the other hand, an Interpreter is software which translates and executes the source program line by line. It does this by reading the code line-by-line and executing it immediately. Unlike a Compiler, which produces an executable file, interpreters do not produce an output file. Instead, they execute the program directly."}
