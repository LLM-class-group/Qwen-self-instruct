On the other hand, an Interpreter is software which translates and executes the source program line by line. It does this by reading the code line-by-line and executing it immediately.

When an event occurs in a moving object, time passes more slowly for that object than it does for someone who observes the event from a stationary position. For example, if a clock is moving at a high speed, its hands will appear to move more sluggishly than a similar clock that is stationary.\n\nOutput:\n\n"}
