It's like when you play a game of \"telephone\" and one person whispers a message to the next person, then the second person does the same, until the message reaches the last person. Recursion works the exact same way, except instead of whispering a simple message, each function passes on a more complex problem to itself. This can be very useful for solving problems that can break down into smaller, simpler problems. But it's important to make sure that the function eventually reaches a base case, which is like the"}
